Javascript:  Fetch API, Element.setAttribute(), Document.createElement(), Node.appendChild(), Node.removeChild(), Node.firstChild

1.- Play with all the elements in the html (display all), and get 
    the DOM control (:-).(at least to handle the display). Check also
    tip #6.(QuerySelectors)
2.- What data type structure are we going to use to handle the 
    collected data?
3.- Initializer (It will collect the data from server to work with 
    and save the data in the appropiate data type , previous step).
    Fetch()--> data
4.- Generate an elements in the UL and add the requested attributes 
    to handle it. (createElement & appendChild)
5.- Automate the previous step to generate all the elements within 
    an UL in the appropiate HTML elements.(iterate with a for on 
    the data type structure)
    (with the step 4 and 5 we have already generated an UL with 
    all the required attributes - once it is done the focus() goes 
    somewhere).
6.- What happen if the style.display property is set to 'list-item' 
    or 'block' in the UL and LI created before?
7.- Generate a filter function that check if the entered string 
    in the search field is included() in the "author" or "title" 
    properties, if found then display, if not found remain not
    display.
