/*
In this task we provide you with the start of a definition 
for a Shape class. It has three properties: name, sides, 
and sideLength. This class only models shapes for which 
all sides are the same length, like a square or an 
equilateral triangle.

We'd like you to:

    Add a constructor to this class. The constructor takes 
    arguments for the name, sides, and sideLength properties, 
    and initializes them.

    Add a new method calcPerimeter() method to the class, 
    which calculates its perimeter (the length of the shape's 
    outer edge) and logs the result to the console.
    
    Create a new instance of the Shape class called square. 
    
    Give it a name of square, 4 sides, and a sideLength of 5.
    
    Call your calcPerimeter() method on the instance, to see 
    whether it logs the calculation result to the browser's 
    console as expected.

    Create a new instance of Shape called triangle, with a 
    name of triangle, 3 sides and a sideLength of 3.

    Call triangle.calcPerimeter() to check that it works OK.

  class Shape {

    name;
    sides;
    sideLength;

  }
