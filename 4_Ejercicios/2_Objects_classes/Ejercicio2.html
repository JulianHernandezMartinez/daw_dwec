    /*
    Next we'd like you to create a Square class that inherits 
    from Shape, and adds a calcArea() method that calculates 
    the square's area. 
    
    Also set up the constructor so that the name property of 
    Square object instances is automatically set to square, 
    and the sides property is automatically set to 4. 
    
    When invoking the constructor, you should therefore just 
    need to provide the sideLength property.

    Create an instance of the Square class called square with 
    appropriate property values, and call its calcPerimeter() 
    and calcArea() methods to show that it works O
